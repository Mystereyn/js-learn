// Just as we can build a string over multiple lines out of string literals, we can also append variables to a string using the plus equals (+=) operator.

//  append = menambahkan
// Example:

// const anAdjective = "awesome!";
// let ourStr = "freeCodeCamp is ";
// ourStr += anAdjective;

const someAdjective = "fun to me";
let myStr = "Learning to code is ";

myStr += someAdjective;
