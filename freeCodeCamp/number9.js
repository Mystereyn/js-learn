// A keyword called let was introduced in ES6, a major update to JavaScript, to solve this potential issue with the var keyword. You'll learn about other ES6 features in later challenges.

// If you replace var with let in the code above, it results in an error:

// let camper = "James";
// let camper = "David";

// The error can be seen in your browser console.
// So unlike var, when you use let, a variable with the same name can only be declared once.
// Update the code so it only uses the let keyword.




// example using var and using let keyword for choose one of variable to showing true  
    // var test1 = "Teuku";
    // var test1 = "rrrr";
    // console.log(test1);

    // let test2 = "reynaldi";
    // let test2 = "p";

    // var catName = "Oliver";
    // var catSound = "Meow!";

    let catName = "Oliver";
    let catSound = "Meow!";
    console.log(catName,catSound);
